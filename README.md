# A M4L (max for Live) device for the MKS-70 and JX10
A Max for Live device for the Roland MKS-70 and JX-10 with Vecoven mod

Prerequisites:
1. MKS-70 or JX10
2. Vecoven Mod v4.x
3. (maybe PWM daughter board)
4. Ableton Live Suite 11 (only one tested, MIGHT work with Live 10)

With this m4l device you can control and edit all (!) parameters of the Roland MKS-70 and JX10 from Ableton Live.
This is done separately for UPPER and LOWER, that's why the device is soooo fucking wide, there's shitloads of parameters, apologies.
I might at some point do a popup version, but would need to learn this first ðŸ˜‡.

The device is currently unidirectional, which means 2 things:
1. The values of the controls will not have a correct representation of the actual values on the synth, UNLESS you change each parameter one on the m4l device.
2. Values will jump to the value you'll click.

There's no patch/preset storage on the device (yet). So if you change something and like it, store it ON the MKS70/JX10 itself. 

This is currently the first public release (internal version 21), so there might be bugs! If you find one, please tell me! (open an "Issue" here on GitHub).

Future plans:
1. make it birectional with patch parsing, so that the shown values represent the actual values.
2. make it prettier and maybe do a popup version
